## Credits
The initial backend was produced by [admineral](https://github.com/admineral).

After our collaboration in an [AI Startup Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/ai-startup-hackathon-episode-3/reactonauts/reactonaut-ai-code-editor), Reactonaut was separated from his original project [Reactor](https://github.com/admineral/Reactor) with a new UI and is being developed as a stand-alone project.
