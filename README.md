Reactonaut was created to reduce the "coding language barrier" and allow new front-end developers to easily experiment with new UI designs with the aid of an AI assistant.

Reactonaut also helps developers allocate more time to bigger ideas, such as UI layouts, overall theme, and functionality, rather than spending time struggling over design tasks.

The initial backend was produced by [admineral](https://github.com/admineral).

After our collaboration in an [AI Startup Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/ai-startup-hackathon-episode-3/reactonauts/reactonaut-ai-code-editor), Reactonaut was separated from his original project [Reactor](https://github.com/admineral/Reactor) with a new UI and is being developed as a stand-alone project.
